# Takashi Murakami DOP-Eye (work in progress)

During the first few weeks, at the coding boot camp at Spiced Academy, I got the idea of ​​programming one of [Takashi Murakmie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Murakami) so-called DOP eyes as little toy and exercise in DOM manipulation and pre ES6 syntax.

If you click on the parts of the eye a random color will be generated and assigned to the div or svg. Two arrays in te background keep track of the users decisions and will rewind the steps after 5 seconds of inactivity.

Visit the [life demo](https://codepen.io/sirpixiejerry/pen/eYVXRLW) to try it yourself.

NEXT THINGS TO IMPLEMENT:

-   use hsl instead of rgb
-   set a variable to chancel setTimeout
-   delete arr after rewind
-   set variable to count through the array and implement functionality to spool through taken steps
